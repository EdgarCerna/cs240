                <h3>Cenotes</h3>
                <aside>
                    Quintana Roo occupies a hot, humid, and heavily forested lowland dotted with cenotes 
                    (water-filled sinkholes) and limestone caves.
                </aside>
                <p>
                    I visited and swam inside of a cenote during my time 
                    in Quintana Roo. Essentially you are inside of a flooded cave with some of the clearest water you 
                    could imagine. While there they had a guide who gave us a tour of the inside of the cave, it was a bit 
                    spooky at first since there were no lights besides our flashlight and bats were flying over our head, 
                    but by the end of it I was amazed by the beauty of the caves.

                <h3>Beaches & Ocean</h3>
                <aside>

                </aside>
                <p>Quintana Roo is the place to be if you love the ocean. You can find a beach anywhere you go, even at your hotel.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>While in Tulum I went on a snorkling tour where we went in the middle of the ocean with life vests.</li>
                    <li>Under us you could see sea life such as sea-turtles, sting rays, fishes, coral, and more. It was an amazing 
                            sight but also terrifying considering we were in the middle of the ocean and I'm not the greatest swimmer, I 
                            imagine most peple are better swimmers than I am.</li>

                <h3>Ancient Mayan Ruins</h3>
                <aside>
                    While snorkling in Tulum I did not take a tour of the ruins but I was able to see them from the outside while on the boat.

                    <em>
                    Dozens of Mayan cities rose to prominence in the region in pre-Hispanic times, as evidenced by ruins at El Meco, 
                    Tixmul, Cobá, Tulum, and elsewhere. In 1517 the first Spanish landing in Mexico was made at Cape Catoche, on the 
                    Yucatán Channel. Many of the present inhabitants are descendants of Maya who rebelled during the Caste War 
                    (an indigenous uprising in the Yucatán in 1847–53) and were not conquered again until the early 20th century. 
                    In 1902 the Quintana Roo territory was carved from parts of Yucatán and Campeche states. It was named for Andrés 
                    Quintana Roo, a writer and leader in the Mexican wars for independence (1810–21). In 1974 it was made a state.
