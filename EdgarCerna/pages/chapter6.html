            <h2>About Some Of The Most Popular Tourist Attractions</h2>
            <h3>Las Vegas Strip</h3>
            <img src="../images/las-vegas-strip.jpg" alt="Las Vegas Strip">
            <p>
                The Las Vegas Strip is the #1 most visited attraction in the world. 
                That comes for good reason, there are so many things to do and see here. 
                It is home to 
                <a href="https://www.tripsavvy.com/downtown-las-vegas-2134513" 
                target="_blank">Downtown Las Vegas</a>
                which is sometimes reffered to as "Old Downtown Las Vegas". 
                <a href="https://www.tripsavvy.com/what-is-the-las-vegas-strip-1679296" 
                target="_blank">The Las Vegas Strip</a> is 
                where most of the major hotels are located as well as the major attractions that you 
                typically read about. All hotels mentioned here will either be on Las Vegas Blvd or 
                on Fremont Street. There are some exceptions such as The Rio, The Palms, Trump Hotel 
                and the Las Vegas Hotel and Casino(Westgate).

            <h3>Times Square</h3>
            <img src="../images/times-square.jpg" alt="Times Square">
            <p>
                Here is a quote by Brittanica on the second most popular tourist attraction, Times Square.
            </p>
            <blockquote cite="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Times-Square">
                Times Square, square in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, formed by the intersection of Seventh Avenue, 
                42nd Street, and Broadway. Times Square is also the centre of the Theatre District, which is bounded 
                roughly by Sixth and Eighth avenues to the east and west, respectively, and by 40th and 53rd streets to 
                the south and north, respectively.<br>
                In 1907 the Times began lowering a huge glass ball down its flagpole at midnight on New Year’s Eve to mark
                the occasion. Throughout the years, ever more sophisticated technology was used for the square’s ball drop 
                as the tradition came to include live television broadcasts that shared the experience with tens of 
                millions of people across the United States.

            <h3>Niagara Falls</h3>
            <img src="../images/niagara-falls.jpg" alt="Niagara Falls">
            <p>
                Niagara Falls is the 5th Most visted attraction in the world and one that I think is very interesting.
                Niagara Falls is a city in New York which is at the Canadian Border. You can see beautiful waterfalls 
                at the state park or go to the Aquarium of Niagara where you can see seals, penguins, sea lions, and 
                much more.
            </p>
            <blockquote cite="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Tourism-g48261-Niagara_Falls_New_York-Vacations.html">
                A popular spot for getting wowed or soaked amid natural splendor, Niagara Falls attracts curious 
                spectators and adventurous honeymooners from around the world. The splendid main attraction - more than 
                six million feet of water cascading over a rocky crest - sits partially in the United States and partially 
                in Canada. The U.S. side has recently been busy promoting other activities to lure visitors. Venues like the 
                Aquarium of Niagara offer parents fun and engaging alternatives for kids, after or in between visits to the Falls. 
                Outdoor recreation such as hiking, biking, fishing and camping can be found at the Niagara Falls State Park. The 
                storied history of attempts to conquer the majestic Falls is captured at the Daredevil Museum; the Schoellkopf Museum 
                concentrates on the history and geology. There's more to the Falls than, well, the Falls, including a wide array of 
                dining and lodging options, from budget to upscale. This awe-inspiring region makes for an exhilarating and multi-faceted 
                getaway
