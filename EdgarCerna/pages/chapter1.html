        <p>
            Often called the Crown Jewel of New Orleans, the French Quarter is one of NOLA's most historic neighborhoods. 
            But you'll find plenty of new mixed in with the old. There’s a reimagined French Market, modern boutiques and artisan cocktails mix with beloved antique stores and old restaurants.

            From dark swamps thick with cypress trees to sun-kissed marshes playing host to herons and egrets, the Mississippi River Delta is a watery but photogenic wonderland. 
            Much of southern Louisiana, where rivers empty their waters and sediment into the Gulf of Mexico, comprises the delta.

        <p>
            Mardi Gras is a Christian holiday and popular cultural phenomenon that dates back thousands of years to pagan spring and fertility rites. 
            Also known as Carnival or Carnaval, it’s celebrated in many countries around the world—mainly those with large Roman Catholic populations—on 
            the day before the religious season of Lent begins. Brazil, Venice and New Orleans play host to some of the holiday’s most famous public festivities, 
            drawing thousands of tourists and revelers every year.
